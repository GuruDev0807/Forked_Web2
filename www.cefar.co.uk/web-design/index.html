                <p>Even the longest journey starts with a single step - and this is equally true about our approach to designing websites. However complex and involved, no matter how many functions a site is intended to fulfil, it's that initial step that is the most important.</p>
                <p>This is why we have developed a systematic approach that we apply at the start of the process.</p>
                <p>So long before we get into the nuts and bolts of coding and programming, we focus on the website's design. This gives us the style and direction to follow as we move forwards, as well as ensuring it helps to either create or maintain a brand identity.</p>
                <p>In the case of branding and brand awareness, Cefar is at a distinct advantage. We also offer an extensive range of other services including brand design / <a class="red" href="ui-ux-design.html">UI UX design</a> and web development. So it becomes as second nature to us to weave this element into the sites that we create.</p>
                <p>Above all, and <a class="red" href="branding.html">branding</a> aside, we're aware that websites that follow good design principles are always more successful. Research has shown. Websites that are poorly designed with little regard for the user experience will lose the attention of up to 40% of all visitors. In fact, research has shown. Websites that are poorly designed with little regard for the user experience will lose the attention of up to 40% of all visitors. This is before they have had a meaningful interaction with the site. If its purpose is to sell directly this is potentially disastrous.</p>
                <p>To ensure that none of our projects ever suffer the same fate. Our designers work hand in hand with our User Experience team to make interaction with every website frictionless.</p>

                <p>While we may have a strict process that we apply to <a class="red" href="development.html">web development</a>, it's by no means a rigid one. Yes, it's designed to ensure that everything is completed in the right order and in a timely way. But it also contains considerable flexibility too.</p>
                <p>This adaptability is driven by the understanding that each client is unique. Their priorities and expectations of a web design agency can greatly differ.</p>
                <p>Over our many years of experience, we've discovered again and again just how important it is to listen to what our clients want.   Then bend over backwards to not just supply it but to exceed it too.</p>
                <p>We are also able to offer this "client-first" approach because of the excellent and in-depth team that we have here at Cefar. Made up of individuals with great skills in their respective areas. It's when everyone comes together that the magic starts to happen.</p>
                <p>And, just as we're agile and flexible in our approach. We can use our extensive resources and real depth of knowledge and experience to <a class="red" href="development.html">develop websites</a> for the most complex requirements. As a leading custom website design agency we understand the importance of research to build the best website for your business.</p>
                <p>In many cases, this means starting with a blank sheet of paper, or screen to be more precise. In others, it means that we have to work to integrate ours with legacy <a class="red" href="../systems.html">systems</a>. We're also very experienced at working alongside our client's own IT departments to ensure that this integration works as smoothly as it possibly can.</p>
                <p>And, while we are most experienced at developing all-new websites. Where an off-the-shelf solution such as <a class="red" href="wordpress.html">WordPress</a> is going to be the best and most cost-effective option, we won't hesitate to recommend it.</p>

                <p>We understand the significance of creating a user-friendly online experience that not only captures your audience's attention but also ensures your website ranks high on search engine results.</p>
                <p>Our commitment to combining cutting-edge web design with effective SEO strategies sets us apart as a holistic solution provider for your online presence.</p>
                <p>A seamless user experience is pivotal in retaining visitors on your site, driving conversions such as purchases or contact form submissions.

                <p>Responsive web design is more than just adapting your website's layout to different devices. It's about creating a seamless and enjoyable experience for users across smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. This not only keeps your visitors engaged but also plays a vital role in enhancing your website's search engine ranking.</p>
                <p>Investing in responsive web design is an investment in your brand's online visibility and user engagement. By seamlessly integrating design and SEO, as a web design agency we ensure your website not only looks exceptional but also ranks prominently on search engine results.</p>
